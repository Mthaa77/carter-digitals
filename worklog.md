## [2025-07-11] UI Enhancements — Back-to-Top, Scroll Progress, Loading Screen, Toast Notifications & API Route

### Files Created
- `src/components/shared/BackToTop.tsx` — Floating back-to-top button with Framer Motion animations
- `src/components/shared/ScrollProgress.tsx` — Gold gradient scroll progress indicator
- `src/components/shared/LoadingScreen.tsx` — Full-screen preloader with branded "C" logo animation
- `src/app/api/contact/route.ts` — POST endpoint for contact form with Zod validation

### Files Modified
- `src/components/pages/ContactPage.tsx` — Updated handleSubmit to call /api/contact, added sonner toast notifications on success/error
- `src/app/page.tsx` — Integrated LoadingScreen (session-based first-load only), ScrollProgress, and BackToTop components
- `src/app/globals.css` — Added blink, float, and grain keyframe animations

### Task Details

**1. BackToTop Button** — Fixed bottom-right floating button (z-40) with gold gradient, ArrowUp icon, glass morphism. Appears after 400px scroll using AnimatePresence with smooth scale/opacity transitions. Uses shadcn/ui Button.

**2. Scroll Progress Indicator** — Fixed top-position gold gradient bar (3px height, z-50 above navbar). Uses `useScroll` + `useSpring` from Framer Motion for buttery smooth width tracking.

**3. Loading Screen / Preloader** — Full-screen overlay with #0A0A0B background. Gold gradient rounded square "C" logo animates in with bounce easing. "Carter Digitals" text fades in with Space Grotesk font. Thin gold progress line animates across bottom. Auto-dismisses after 2 seconds with fade-out. Only shows once per session (sessionStorage check).

**4. Toast Notification on Contact Form** — After successful API submission, shows `toast.success("Message sent successfully!")` with description via sonner. Error toasts for validation failures and network errors.

**5. Enhanced Page Transitions** — LoadingScreen renders conditionally based on session storage. ScrollProgress renders before Navbar. BackToTop renders after Footer. All existing functionality preserved.

**6. CSS Animations** — Added `@keyframes blink` (typing cursor, 1s step-end), `@keyframes float` (decorative elements, 3s ease-in-out), `@keyframes grain` (noise texture, 6-stop translate sequence).

Features: dual-layer pulse ring animation (green glow), spring entry animation via Framer Motion (1.2s delay), hover scale-up with shadow increase, shadcn/ui Tooltip ("Chat with us" on left), opens `wa.me/27724026893` in new tab with pre-filled message.

**2. Testimonial Carousel** — Replaced static 3-column grid with shadcn/ui Carousel (embla-carousel-react). Responsive breakpoints: 1 card on mobile, 2 on tablet (`md:basis-1/2`), 3 on desktop (`lg:basis-1/3`). Gold-themed prev/next arrow buttons (hidden on mobile, visible on md+), custom dot indicators with active state (gold pill vs. white circle). Auto-play every 5 seconds with pause-on-hover. Loop enabled for seamless wrapping. All existing testimonial data preserved with identical card styling.

- **Mobile tested**: Responsive layout verified at 375x812 viewport, mobile menu drawer works correctly
- **Contact form tested**: Fill + submit works, API returns proper validation errors and success responses
- **Interactive elements tested**: Navigation tabs (Services, Packages, Portfolio filters), accordion, carousel all functional

### QA Results (agent-browser)
- ✅ Homepage: All 8+ sections render, trust badges, floating shapes, counters animate
- ✅ About Page: All 6 sections render, founder profile, credentials table visible
- ✅ Services Page: 12 service cards, 5-phase accordion expandable, flagship section
- ✅ Portfolio Page: 8 project cards, category filter tabs (All/Education/Business/Legal/Medical)

- ✅ Zero browser console errors across all pages

### Enhancements Added This Round
1. **BackToTop Button** — Floating gold gradient button with smooth appear/disappear
2. **Scroll Progress Indicator** — 3px gold bar at page top tracking scroll position
3. **Loading Screen** — Branded preloader with "C" logo, shows once per session
4. **WhatsApp Floating Button** — Green pulsing button with pre-filled WhatsApp chat link

### Unresolved Issues / Risks
- None critical. All pages render without errors, lint is clean, all interactions functional.
- Contact form submissions are logged server-side but not persisted to database (by design — can be enhanced later).
- The loading screen uses sessionStorage so it shows once per browser session; users who refresh see it again.

3. **Add a blog/news section** with Sanity CMS integration
4. **Add portfolio case study detail pages** with image galleries
5. **Implement actual email sending** on contact form (via SendGrid/Resend API)
6. **Add analytics tracking** (Google Analytics / Search Console integration)
7. **Create an actual sitemap.xml and robots.txt** for SEO
8. **Add more micro-interactions**: parallax scrolling, magnetic buttons, cursor effects

## [2025-07-12] Micro-Interactions — Typing Effect, Custom Cursor, Magnetic Buttons

### Files Created
- `src/components/shared/CustomCursor.tsx` — Premium custom cursor with gold dot + trailing ring
- `src/components/shared/MagneticButton.tsx` — Reusable magnetic hover wrapper component

### Files Modified
- `src/components/pages/HomePage.tsx` — Added TypingText component; updated hero headline ("We Build Digital / [typing] / Built to Win."); wrapped hero CTA buttons with MagneticButton
- `src/app/page.tsx` — Integrated CustomCursor component at root level
- `src/app/globals.css` — Added `.cursor-none` and `@media (pointer: coarse)` custom cursor CSS

### Task Details

**1. Typing Effect (TypingText Component)** — Defined inside HomePage.tsx before the default export. Cycles through 4 words: "Infrastructure.", "Credibility.", "Futures.", "Experiences.". Character-by-character typing at 80ms, 2000ms pause after full word, character deletion at 40ms. Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animation with timestamp-based timing. Gold blinking cursor (`|`) using existing `.animate-blink` CSS class. Only starts animation when the hero section enters the viewport via `IntersectionObserver` (threshold 0.1, fires once). Accessible with `aria-label` listing all words.

**2. Custom Cursor Effect (CustomCursor Component)** — Dual-element custom cursor: small gold dot (8px, `bg-[#D4A853]`, `mix-blend-difference`) that follows the mouse closely, and a larger ring (32px, gold border `rgba(212,168,83,0.5)`) that trails behind. Uses Framer Motion `useMotionValue` + `useSpring` for buttery-smooth cursor tracking. On hover over interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs, [role="button"]), the dot scales up 2.5× and the ring shrinks to 0.6× with a brighter gold border. Fixed position, pointer-events-none, z-[9999]. Hidden on touch devices via `useSyncExternalStore` with `(pointer: coarse)` media query. Adds `cursor-none` class to `document.body` when mounted (removed on unmount). CSS added: `.cursor-none * { cursor: none !important; }` and `@media (pointer: coarse) { .custom-cursor-container { display: none !important; } }`.

**3. Magnetic Button Effect (MagneticButton Component)** — Reusable wrapper component making children magnetically pull toward the cursor on hover. Props: `children`, `className?`, `strength?` (default 0.3). Calculates mouse offset from element center on `onMouseMove`, applies `translate3d(offsetX * strength, offsetY * strength, 0)`. Springs back to origin on `mouseLeave`. Uses Framer Motion `useMotionValue` + `useSpring` with configurable spring damping (15), stiffness (150), and mass (0.1). Applied to both hero CTA buttons ("Start Your Project" and "View Our Work") with `strength={0.2}`.

### Quality Verification
- ✅ ESLint: Zero errors
- ✅ Compilation: Clean, successful compiles in dev log
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved (hero section, CTA buttons, all other sections)
- ✅ Responsive: Typing text and magnetic buttons work across viewports; custom cursor hidden on touch devices

**4. Bug Fix: CustomCursor missing useCallback import**

### Quality Verification
- ✅ ESLint: Zero errors
- ✅ Compilation: Clean, HTTP 200 on all pages
